# tund.in

This is the webapp for tund.in. To start the app, clone the repo to your machine, `cd tundin`, and `npm install`. Once installation is complete, use `npm start` to start up the webpack dev server.

The app consumes tundin-api and so that must be running on a seperate port on your machine. By default port 4200 is used but this can be changed on line 4 of app/middleware/api.js in this app.
